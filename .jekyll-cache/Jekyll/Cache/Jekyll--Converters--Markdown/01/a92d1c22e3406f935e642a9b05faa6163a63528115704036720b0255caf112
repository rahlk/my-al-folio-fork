I"¥<p>I work in the intersection of Machine Learning and Programming Languages for modernizing and mainitaining cloud-native applications. Prior to this, I was Post doctoral fellow at Columbia University working with <a href="rayb.info">Dr. Baishakhi Ray</a> where my research explored the ways in which Machine Learning can be used to <em>trigger, detect, and repair</em> various problem across the software lifecycle.</p>

<p>I obtained my PhD at NC State University, guided by <a href="https://menzies.us">Dr. Tim Menzies</a>. I worked on <em>actionable analytics</em> for software engineering throughout my PhD. I created algorithms that go beyond prediction to provide insights that might help people make better decisions. I have focused on data mining approaches (transfer learning) that can create insights even when there isnâ€™t enough data.</p>
