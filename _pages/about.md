I work in the intersection of Machine Learning and Programming Languages for modernizing and mainitaining cloud-native applications. Prior to this, I was Post doctoral fellow at Columbia University working with [Dr. Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/) where my research explored the ways in which Machine Learning can be used to *trigger, detect, and repair* various problem across the software lifecycle.

I obtained my PhD at NC State University, guided by [Dr. Tim Menzies](http://menzies.us). I worked on *actionable analytics* for software engineering. I created algorithms that go beyond prediction to provide insights that might help developers make better decisions. I focused on data mining approaches (e.g., transfer learning) that can create insights even when there isn't enough data.
